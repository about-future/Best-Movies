# Best Movies

### Description
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, I built an app that allows users to discover the most popular movies, using themoviedb.org API.

### Features
- Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting. The sort order can be:
  - Most Popular
  - Top Rated
  - Upcoming
  - Now Playing
- Allow the user to create a list of favourite movies
- Allow the user to create a list of favourite actors
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - a plot synopsis
  - user rating
  - release date and more
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie
- Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser)

  
### Libraries Used
- Picasso v2.71828 to handle loading and caching images.
- ButterKnife v8.8.1 for binding views easily.
- Retrofit v2.4.0 to easily retrieve and serialize JSON files.
